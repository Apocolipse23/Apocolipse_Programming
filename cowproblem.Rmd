The context for the problem is as follows:

A farmer has a regular circiular field filled with grass.
If he ties a cow to the edge of the circle, how long does the lead
have to be in order for the cow to eat exactly half of the field.

One approach involves a geometric approach of calculating the total area
using arcs and sectors of two joined circles.

Another valid approach involves polar coordinates. The former methods was 
used to find a solution.
```{r}
library(rootSolve)
library(Rmpfr)
math_function <- function(x) {
  value <- (x*cos(x) - sin(x/2) + (pi/2))
  return(value);
}
curve(math_function(x), 0, 2*pi)
abline(h = 0, lty = 3)
abline(v = 0, lty = 2)
solutions_list <- uniroot.all(math_function, c(0, 2*pi))
points(solutions_list, y = rep(0, length(solutions_list)), pch = 16, cex = 1)


check_function <- function(x) {
  value <- (2*x*cos(x/2)*cos(x/2)) + (pi/2) - (x) - (sin(x/2))
  return(value);
}

check_function(solutions_list)
solutions_list

mpfr(solutions_list[1], precBits=2)

2*cos(solutions_list[1]/2)
```


So, the length of the rope the cow is tethered to must be 1.1152 times the radius of
the circular enclosure.
